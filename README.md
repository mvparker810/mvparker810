ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Marshall.

I'm a Sophomore Computer Science B.S Major at the University Of Delaware. I'm a passionate software developer with experience in low-level systems programming, and recently, I've been diving into fullstack web development. I feel most fulfilled when I'm turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. Outside of programming, I enjoy making art, gaming, and writing narratives.
